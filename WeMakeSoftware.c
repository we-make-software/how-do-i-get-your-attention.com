# WeMakeSoftware.c

This file contains the core logic for the kernel module, including the initialization and cleanup functions. It relies on the definitions provided in `WeMakeSoftware.h`.

### Key Functions:

- **WeMakeSoftwareInit**: 
  This function is called when the module is loaded. It logs an informational message using the `Info` macro and returns `0` to indicate successful initialization.
  
  ```c
  static int __init WeMakeSoftwareInit(void)
  {
      Info("Module initialized successfully");
      return 0;  // Return 0 to indicate successful loading
  }
  ```

- **WeMakeSoftwareExit**: 
  This function is called when the module is removed from the kernel. Currently, it does not perform any specific cleanup tasks.
  
  ```c
  static void __exit WeMakeSoftwareExit(void)
  {
      // Cleanup code (if needed) would go here
  }
  ```

### Module Initialization and Exit:
The `module_init()` and `module_exit()` macros are used to define the entry and exit points for the kernel module.

```c
module_init(WeMakeSoftwareInit);
module_exit(WeMakeSoftwareExit);
```

### Metadata:
The `MODULE_METADATA()` macro is used to include essential information about the module, such as:
- The license (`GPL`)
- A brief description
- The author
