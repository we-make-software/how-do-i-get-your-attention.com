# Storage.h

The `Storage.h` file provides essential declarations for handling storage operations, including reading and writing data, as well as managing the size of the storage. It ensures efficient integration with `MemoryManager.h` for proper memory management during these operations.

This file introduces two enums, `StorageWriteResult` and `StorageReadResult`, which define the outcomes of storage write and read operations. `StorageWriteResult` includes `StorageWriteSuccess` and `StorageWriteError`, representing whether the write operation was successful or if an error occurred. Similarly, `StorageReadResult` includes `StorageReadSuccess` and `StorageReadError`, indicating the success or failure of read operations.

In addition to these enums, `Storage.h` provides several function declarations. `GetStorageSize()` is used to retrieve the current size of the storage, helping ensure that all read and write operations stay within the bounds of the allocated storage space. The `StorageWrite()` function allows writing data to storage at a specific position and returns a result based on the outcome of the operation. Similarly, the `StorageRead()` function is responsible for reading data from a specified position in the storage and returns a result indicating whether the read was successful or if an error occurred.
