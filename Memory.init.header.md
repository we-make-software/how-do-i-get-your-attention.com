# Memory.init.header.md

This header file is specifically designed to be included in **`wms.c`** and handles the initialization process for memory-related functions within the project. Using `#pragma once` ensures the file is included only once during compilation, avoiding multiple inclusion issues.

The key declaration in this file is:

```c
extern void memoryInit(void);
```

This declaration uses the `extern` keyword to inform the compiler that the function `memoryInit` is defined in another source file (likely `Memory.c`) and will be linked at compile time. The function takes no arguments, as indicated by the empty parentheses, and it does not return a value. When invoked, the `memoryInit` function is responsible for initializing memory-related components, ensuring that the memory system is properly set up for use within the `wms` module.

By declaring the function as `extern`, it allows the function to be accessed in **`wms.c`** without being defined there. This helps maintain modularity and reuse across different parts of the project, promoting a cleaner and more efficient code structure. Including this header in **`wms.c`** ensures that the necessary memory initialization is seamlessly integrated into the module's overall setup.
