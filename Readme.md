# We-Make-Software

## Purpose

Establishing clear ground rules for development is essential, especially in open-source environments, as it enables developers to build high-quality software. By setting up a robust development framework with `extern`, `EXPORT_SYMBOL()`, and well-structured header files, we’re creating a toolkit of modular, reusable components across kernel modules, setting the foundation for efficient and scalable development workflows.

Having access to project-specific files empowers skilled developers who understand the value of modular design and kernel development. This level of insight requires a deep understanding of these principles, which go beyond amateur skill levels.

This project encourages exploration of Linux's potential in modular software development.

## Professional and Personal Insights

Consider the cost of employing a university-educated developer. I earn 170 DKK/hour before tax, without pension benefits. This wage is fair, as I bring considerable value to the company. Working in IT, I can independently create and develop tools, though sometimes it’s unclear what others in the team can contribute.

If I build this project as an open-source initiative, I would consider hosting it on GitHub or another platform to attract sponsorship from developers, organizations, or companies supporting open-source innovation.

Investing in this project enables me to provide valuable software solutions that benefit both my company and the broader community. For businesses engaging in e-commerce, promotions, or social media, I plan to integrate tools to simplify these tasks. The code will start with `WeMakeSoftware.c`, aligning with the company's brand as "We-Make-Software," an online provider of comprehensive software solutions.

## Vision and Goals

I intend to build software that helps companies identify and correct system issues. This project will evolve into a full cloud-based system covering storage, websites, reviews, social media integration, and everything necessary to promote and manage a business online.

## Why Linux and C?

Many rely on Linux for tasks ranging from web servers to VoIP. C, as the language closest to the Linux kernel, is the most powerful option for system-level development. I use Ubuntu for its advanced features, but C remains essential for building kernel-related solutions.

## Networking and Redundancy

Linux offers flexibility for disk management, allowing for drives bound to multiple physical disks, with or without RAID. RAID provides redundancy and reliability, ensuring data safety even if a drive fails.

Building the first server correctly is a testament to doing things right from the start.


#### Further Information

Basic programming in IEEE 802.3 in C is a foundational element. We-Make-Software.com aims to build an open-source project for IEEE 802.3, beginning with our initial build version.

# This is what we see:

When data enters our network card, it follows the IEEE 802.3 standard, a foundational protocol widely used in networking. Packets come in various types, often identified by an Ethertype, which is essential for firewalls worldwide to manage and control network traffic.

We only accept data that is more than 42 bytes.

Our goal is to monitor and provide tasks for clients. We offer a variety of services, which can be paid directly to We-Make-Software to support clients. This is our firewall. We adhere to standards for IPv4 packets as defined by RFC 791 and RFC 8200. Our solution is open source, but we only publish it when we have the time and resources to do so.

Because we want to be a valuable tool for you, we made the choices we did.
