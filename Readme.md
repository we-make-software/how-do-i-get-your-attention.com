*We don't know how long a process takes, but we can find out—that's called output.<br/>
Basically, I don't like making README files or markdown (md) files,<br/>
so I think I need to come up with something in wms.h.<br/>
We have the following functions: 'waitForMalloc', 'setLiveDocumentionFilename',<br/>
'liveDocumentionDisable', 'liveDocumentionEnable', and 'setLiveDocumentionWrite'.<br/>
We can continue to improve how we create README (md) files.<br/>
But that’s a project in itself.*<br/><br/>
