# We-Make-Software

## Purpose

Establishing clear ground rules for development is essential, especially in open-source environments, as it enables developers to build high-quality software. By setting up a robust development framework with `extern`, `EXPORT_SYMBOL()`, and well-structured header files, we’re creating a toolkit of modular, reusable components across kernel modules, setting the foundation for efficient and scalable development workflows.

Having access to project-specific files empowers skilled developers who understand the value of modular design and kernel development. This level of insight requires a deep understanding of these principles, which go beyond amateur skill levels.

This project encourages exploration of Linux's potential in modular software development.

## Professional and Personal Insights

Consider the cost of employing a university-educated developer. I earn 170 DKK/hour before tax, without pension benefits. This wage is fair, as I bring considerable value to the company. Working in IT, I can independently create and develop tools, though sometimes it’s unclear what others in the team can contribute.

If I build this project as an open-source initiative, I would consider hosting it on GitHub or another platform to attract sponsorship from developers, organizations, or companies supporting open-source innovation.

Investing in this project enables me to provide valuable software solutions that benefit both my company and the broader community. For businesses engaging in e-commerce, promotions, or social media, I plan to integrate tools to simplify these tasks. The code will start with `WeMakeSoftware.c`, aligning with the company's brand as "We-Make-Software," an online provider of comprehensive software solutions.

## Vision and Goals

I intend to build software that helps companies identify and correct system issues. This project will evolve into a full cloud-based system covering storage, websites, reviews, social media integration, and everything necessary to promote and manage a business online.

## Why Linux and C?

Many rely on Linux for tasks ranging from web servers to VoIP. C, as the language closest to the Linux kernel, is the most powerful option for system-level development. I use Ubuntu for its advanced features, but C remains essential for building kernel-related solutions.

## Networking and Redundancy

Linux offers flexibility for disk management, allowing for drives bound to multiple physical disks, with or without RAID. RAID provides redundancy and reliability, ensuring data safety even if a drive fails.

Building the first server correctly is a testament to doing things right from the start.
