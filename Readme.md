Who is the Client on the Internet?

The client on the internet is typically the entity (software or device) that initiates a request for information or services from a server. For example:

A web browser requesting a web page from a web server.
A mobile app fetching data from an API.
A computer sending a DNS query to resolve a domain name.
In essence, the client is the "requester," while the server is the "responder."

Note to Myself: Building This Understanding with OpenAI

I am using OpenAI to refine my writing and learn better communication skills. While I am not perfect and write more naturally in Danish, OpenAI helps me improve and express my thoughts clearly in English.

Learning Resource: RFC 826
RFC 826 is a foundational document describing the Address Resolution Protocol (ARP), which maps IP addresses to hardware (MAC) addresses in a local network. Understanding ARP is crucial for networking and understanding how devices communicate on the internet.
