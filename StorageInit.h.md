# StorageInit.h

The `StorageInit.h` file provides two external functions, `StorageInit()` and `StorageExit()`, which are utilized in `wms.c`. 

- `StorageInit()` is responsible for initializing the storage system.
- `StorageExit()` is responsible for cleaning up and exiting the storage system.

These functions are only required within `wms.c`.
