# Memory.Header.md
This header file is designed as a standard component that can be included across multiple projects. It provides a foundational layer for memory management while ensuring compatibility with the broader **`wms`** module through the inclusion of **`wms.h`**. By using `#pragma once`, the file is protected from being included multiple times in a single compilation, ensuring efficient and error-free integration.

The external declarations in this header are intended to be implemented in various projects, making it a flexible and reusable part of any system that requires dynamic memory management.
