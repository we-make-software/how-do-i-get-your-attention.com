# Memory.Header.md

This header file is designed to ensure proper memory management integration in the project. It includes **`wms.h`**, linking this file directly to the broader **`wms`** module for seamless interaction. The use of `#pragma once` prevents multiple inclusions during compilation, ensuring the file is processed only once for efficiency and to avoid redefinition issues.

This file provides essential external declarations that will be implemented in the source files, making it a key part of the project's structure for managing memory operations.
