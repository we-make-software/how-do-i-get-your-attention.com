# wms.c
The `wms.c` file is responsible for initializing and cleaning up the `MemoryManager` and `Storage` systems within the `wms` module. It contains two key functions:

- `wmsInit()` — Initializes both the `MemoryManager` and `Storage`.
- `wmsExit()` — Cleans up and exits both systems in reverse order.

This file is critical for proper module management in the system.
